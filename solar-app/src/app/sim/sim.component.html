  <h2>Instructions</h2>
  <p>
    Use the controls to adjust the load from 0% to 100% and see how the stored power
    in the system varies. You can also either supply more power from the wind generator
    ,if available, or if there is plenty of solar eneergy convert the generator into a
    fan motor.
  </p>
  <p>
    If both motor and generator are on then the direction of current will depend on whether
    the energy being produced from the wind is greater than the energy already in the system.
  </p>
  <p>
    The stored energy should not exceed 2.5v but needs to be above about 1.7v in order for
    the load (red LED) to switch on, even dimly.
  </p>
  <p>
    The orange LED prevents serious overcharging of the storage device and represents
    energy wasted by too much supply with a low demand.

    <h3>Solar Volts</h3>
    <p>
      The solar volts gives an indication of the power being provided through solar
      photovoltaic energy

    <h3>Store Volts</h3>
    <p>
      The store volts indicates the available power to drive the load or the motor.
      As solar or wind energy is fed into the system the store voltage should rise. If
      neither energy source is providing power then the load must be powered from
      stored energy.

    <h3>Load Current</h3>
    <p>
      The load current indicates the power being used by a hypothetical consumer
      represented by the red LED. In reality this could be a home, a factory, or
      any other utility connected to the grid.
    </p>

    <h3>Generator / Motor</h3>
    <p>
      The generator high voltage and generator low voltage shows the potential
      difference across the generator. Depending on how the motor and generator
      switchs are set this could be providing wind energy as a generator or
      consuming energy as a motor. In renewable energy systems it is useful to be
      able to control the direction of power depending on supply and demand
      fluctuations
